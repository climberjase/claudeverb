# Plan Manager Workflow Examples

This document provides comprehensive examples of common workflows using the plan-manager skill.

## Starting Fresh (with Config Setup)

```
User: "Let's implement the new layout engine"
Claude: *Creates plans/layout-engine.md with 5 phases*

User: "/plan-manager init plans/layout-engine.md"
Claude: ✓ Initialized master plan: plans/layout-engine.md (flat)
        ✓ Added Status Dashboard with 5 phases

        Configure category organization for standalone plans?

        │ ○ Configure now (Recommended)                           │
        │   Set up category directories (migrations/, docs/, etc.)│
        │                                                         │
        │ ○ Use defaults                                          │
        │   Use built-in defaults (migrations, docs, designs,     │
        │   etc.)                                                 │
        │                                                         │
        │ ○ Skip for now                                          │
        │   Don't set up categories yet, I'll configure later     │
        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

User: *Selects "Use defaults"*
Claude: ✓ Will use default category directories

        Initialization complete! You can customize category directories
        later by running `/plan-manager config --edit`

User: *Working on Phase 2...*
User: "Wait, we need to rethink the grid system"
Claude: *Creates plans/grid-rethink.md*

User: "/plan-manager capture"
Claude: I see you just created plans/grid-rethink.md. Which phase does this relate to?
User: "Phase 2"
Claude: ✓ Promoted master plan to subdirectory: plans/layout-engine/
        ✓ Moved plans/layout-engine.md → plans/layout-engine/layout-engine.md
        ✓ Moved plans/grid-rethink.md → plans/layout-engine/grid-rethink.md
        ✓ Captured plans/layout-engine/grid-rethink.md → linked to Phase 2
        ✓ Updated master plan Status Dashboard

User: "/plan-manager status"
Claude: Master Plan: plans/layout-engine/layout-engine.md (subdirectory: layout-engine/)

        Phase 1: ✅ Complete
        Phase 2: 🔄 In Progress
          └─ plans/layout-engine/grid-rethink.md (In Progress)
        Phase 3: ⏳ Pending
        ...
```

## Using Nested Structure (Opt-in)

```
User: "I want this plan organized in its own folder from the start"
Claude: "Use the --nested flag to immediately create a subdirectory"

User: "/plan-manager init plans/simple-feature.md --nested"
Claude: ✓ Created subdirectory: plans/simple-feature/
        ✓ Moved plans/simple-feature.md → plans/simple-feature/simple-feature.md
        ✓ Initialized master plan: plans/simple-feature/simple-feature.md (nested)
        ✓ Added Status Dashboard with 3 phases

User: "/plan-manager branch 2"
Claude: *Creates plans/simple-feature/feature-branch.md (in subdirectory)*
        ✓ Created branch: plans/simple-feature/feature-branch.md (branched from Phase 2)
```

        RENAME (1 randomly-named file)
          abstract-floating-jenkins.md → performance-notes.md (based on content: render performance analysis)

        CATEGORIZE (3 standalone plans → category subdirs)

        LINK (2 plans → parent plans)
          performance-notes.md → Master: layout-engine.md → Phase 4: Performance Optimization
          edge-cases.md        → Master: layout-engine.md → Phase 2: Grid Engine

## Creating Nested Sub-plans

```
User: "/plan-manager sub-plan 3"
Claude: *Creates plans/layout-engine/grid-rethink.md for Phase 3*
        ✓ Created sub-plan: plans/layout-engine/grid-rethink.md (for Phase 3 implementation)

User: *Works on grid-rethink.md, which has 4 steps*
User: "Step 2 of the grid rethink needs its own detailed plan"

User: "/plan-manager sub-plan 2 --parent plans/layout-engine/grid-rethink.md"
Claude: What's this sub-plan about?
User: "Edge case handling for nested grids"
Claude: ✓ Created sub-plan: plans/layout-engine/nested-grid-edges.md (for Step 2 of grid-rethink.md)

        *File created with:*
        **Parent:** plans/layout-engine/grid-rethink.md → Step 2
        **Master:** plans/layout-engine/layout-engine.md

        *grid-rethink.md updated:*
        2. 📋 Handle nested grid edge cases
           > Sub-plan: [nested-grid-edges.md](./nested-grid-edges.md)

        This sub-plan is complete. How should it be integrated?
        [User selects "Just mark complete"]

        ✓ Updated grid-rethink.md Step 2 icon to ✅

        All steps in the parent sub-plan (grid-rethink.md) are now complete.
        Mark it as complete too?
