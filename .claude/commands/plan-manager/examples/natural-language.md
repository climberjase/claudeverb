### Audit Command Output

```
Audit Results:

⚠️  Orphaned sub-plan: plans/old-idea.md (not linked to master)
⚠️  Broken link: plans/deleted.md (in state but file missing)
⚠️  Missing back-reference: plans/tangent.md (no Parent header)
⚠️  Invalid parentStep: plans/layout-engine/edge-cases.md references Step 5 in grid-rethink.md, but grid-rethink.md only has 3 steps
⚠️  Orphaned nested: plans/layout-engine/deep-fix.md parent sub-plan (grid-rethink.md) no longer exists
⚠️  Missing Master header: plans/layout-engine/edge-cases.md is nested but has no **Master:** field
⚠️  masterPlan mismatch: plans/layout-engine/edge-cases.md state says masterPlan is "plans/other.md" but chain resolves to "plans/layout-engine/layout-engine.md"
✓  No stale phases detected

Recommendations:
- Run `/plan-manager capture plans/old-idea.md` to link orphan
- Manually remove the broken entry from `.claude/plan-manager-state.json` to clean up broken links
- Fix parentStep references by updating state or re-linking the sub-plan
- Re-link orphaned nested sub-plans to a new parent or remove them
```

### Merge Command Example

```
User: "/plan-manager merge grid-edge-cases.md"
Claude: *Reads plan content*

        How should this plan's content be merged?

## Rename Pattern Detection

Names are considered "random" or meaningless if they match patterns like:
- `{adjective}-{adjective}-{noun}.md` (e.g., lexical-puzzling-emerson.md)
- `{word}-{word}-{word}.md` with no semantic connection to content
- UUID-style names
- Generic names like `plan-1.md`, `new-plan.md`, `untitled.md`

When detected, the skill will suggest meaningful names based on:
- The plan's title/heading
- Key topics and keywords
- Parent phase context (if linked)

## Context-Aware "add" Command

The `add` command intelligently routes based on context:

### As Master Plan (no phase context)
When you say "add this plan" without mentioning a phase, it creates a new master plan:
```
User: "add this plan"
Claude: *Routes to init command*
        ✓ Initialized master plan: plans/new-plan.md
```

### As Sub-plan/Branch (with phase context)
When you mention a phase, it captures the plan and links it to that phase:
```
User: "add this to phase 2"
Claude: *Routes to capture command with phase 2*
        ✓ Captured plan.md → linked to Phase 2
```

### Intelligent Phase Detection
When you say "add this to the master plan" without specifying which phase:
1. Analyzes recent conversation for phase context
2. Checks plan content for clues about which phase it relates to
3. Looks at current in-progress or pending phases
4. If confident, suggests a phase with confirmation
5. If unclear, asks with intelligent options

```
User: "add this to the master plan"
Claude: *Analyzes context, sees Phase 3 was recently discussed*
        I'll add this to Phase 3: API Layer based on recent discussion. Is that correct?

User: "yes"
Claude: ✓ Captured plan.md → linked to Phase 3
```

Or if unclear:
```
User: "add this to the master plan"
Claude: Which phase should this plan be linked to?

        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ Phase 2: Layout Engine (In Progress)    │
        │ Phase 3: API Layer (Pending)            │
        │ Phase 4: Testing (Pending)              │
        │ Other phase                              │
        └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Tips

- Run '/plan-manager' with no command for interactive menu
- Use natural language: "capture that plan", "organize my plans"
- Phase completion is auto-detected when you say "Phase X is complete"
- Merge branch plans back into master to consolidate updates
- Category organization keeps different plan types separated
- Subdirectories keep master plans and sub-plans together
- Settings are optional - defaults work great for most projects
- Project settings override user settings for team consistency
