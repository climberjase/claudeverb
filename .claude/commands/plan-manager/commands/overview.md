# Command: overview

## Usage

```
overview [directory]
```

Discover and visualize all plans in the project, regardless of whether they're tracked in state.

**This command works even without initialization** — useful for understanding an existing project's plans.

## Steps

> **Terminology:** Throughout this document, "Phase" also includes "Milestone" or "Step" when used as section headers. Detect which term the plan uses and preserve it. See SKILL.md § Terminology.

0. **Load settings**: Read `enableCategoryOrganization` from settings using the standard lookup order:
   - `~/.claude/plan-manager-settings.json` (user-wide)
   - `.claude/plan-manager-settings.json` (project-specific, overrides user)
   - Built-in default: `true`
   - The resolved value of `enableCategoryOrganization` governs all category-related behavior in steps below.

1. **Determine plans directory**:
   - If `directory` argument provided: use that path
   - Otherwise: use **Plans Directory Detection** (see [organization.md](../organization.md))
   - This establishes which directory to scan

2. **Scan all markdown files** in the directory and subdirectories:
   - Recursively scan the plans directory for `.md` files
   - Include files in subdirectories (e.g., `plans/layout-engine/*.md`)
   - Read each `.md` file
   - Classify each file by analyzing its content:

   | Classification | Detection Criteria |
   |----------------|-------------------|
   | **Master Plan** | Has phases/steps (## Phase N or ## Step N), may have Status Dashboard |
   | **Sub-plan (linked)** | Has `**Parent:**` header pointing to a master plan (→ Phase N) |
   | **Sub-plan (nested, linked)** | Has `**Parent:**` header pointing to another sub-plan (→ Step N) and `**Master:**` header |
   | **Sub-plan (orphaned)** | Looks like a sub-plan but no Parent reference or parent doesn't exist |
   | **Standalone Plan** | Has plan structure but no phase/step hierarchy |
   | **Completed** | Has `**Status:** Completed` or all phases/steps marked ✅ |
   | **Abandoned** | Old modification date, marked as abandoned, or superseded |
   | **Reference Doc** | Not a plan — just documentation |

   **Additionally, if `enableCategoryOrganization` is true, classify standalone plans by category** for organization. If `enableCategoryOrganization` is false, skip this classification — standalone plans are simply "Standalone Plan" with no category label.

   | Category | Detection Criteria |
   |----------|-------------------|
   | **Documentation** | Titles/content include "docs", "documentation", "guide", "manual", "how-to", "reference" |
   | **Migration** | Titles/content include "migration", "migrate", "upgrade", "transition", "port" |
   | **Design** | Titles/content include "design", "architecture", "proposal", "RFC", "spec" |
   | **Feature** | Titles/content include "feature", "enhancement", "new", "add" |
   | **Bugfix** | Titles/content include "bug", "fix", "issue", "problem", "error" |
   | **Reference** | Pure reference material, glossaries, decision logs |
   | **Standalone** | Doesn't match other categories |

3. **Build relationship graph**:
   - Map parent → children relationships by following `parentPlan` chains
   - Identify which sub-plans link to which master plans (directly or through nested parents)
   - Build the full tree: master → sub-plans → nested sub-plans (arbitrary depth)
   - Detect circular references or broken links
   - Extract blocker information from phase sections and state file
   - For blocked phases, determine what's blocking them (phases, steps, or sub-plans)

4. **Display ASCII hierarchy chart**:
   - Show phase status with emojis (✅ Complete, 🔄 In Progress, ⏸️ Blocked, ⏳ Pending)
   - For blocked phases, include blocker details: `⏸️ Blocked by Phase 3` or `⏸️ Blocked by Phase 3, api-redesign.md`
   - Blocker format:
     - Phase blockers: `Phase N`
     - Step blockers: `Step N.M`
     - Sub-plan blockers: filename only (e.g., `api-redesign.md`)
     - Multiple blockers: comma-separated
   - **If `enableCategoryOrganization` is false**: omit the `BY CATEGORY` and `UNCATEGORIZED STANDALONE` sections entirely. Also omit the `├── Category-organized: N` line from the SUMMARY.

**When `enableCategoryOrganization` is true (default):**

5. **Interactive cleanup for orphaned/completed**:

If orphaned, unlinked completed, or (when `enableCategoryOrganization` is true) uncategorized standalone plans are found, use the **AskUserQuestion tool** with descriptive options.

When `enableCategoryOrganization` is **true**, include uncategorized standalone in the prompt and offer "Organize all":

```
Question: "Found 2 orphaned plans, 1 completed plan, and 5 uncategorized standalone plans. How would you like to handle them?"
Header: "Cleanup"
Options:
  - Label: "Organize all"
    Description: "Fix broken state, flatten solo nested plans, rename, categorize, link related plans, then archive completed"
  - Label: "Review individually"
    Description: "I'll show a summary of each plan and ask what to do with it one by one"
  - Label: "Move completed"
    Description: "Move completed unlinked plans to plans/completed/ directory"
  - Label: "Leave as-is"
    Description: "Just show the report, don't take any action"
```

When `enableCategoryOrganization` is **false**, omit uncategorized standalone from the prompt and omit "Organize all" (since the main reason to organize would be categorization):

```
Question: "Found 2 orphaned plans and 1 completed plan. How would you like to handle them?"
Header: "Cleanup"
Options:
  - Label: "Review individually"
    Description: "I'll show a summary of each plan and ask what to do with it one by one"
  - Label: "Move completed"
    Description: "Move completed unlinked plans to plans/completed/ directory"
  - Label: "Leave as-is"
    Description: "Just show the report, don't take any action"
```

Based on selection:
- **Organize all**: Switch to the `organize` workflow — organize by category, analyze relationships, suggest links, then cleanup
- **Review individually**: For each plan, show content summary and use AskUserQuestion again: Organize by category? Link to phase? Move to completed? Delete? Skip? (When `enableCategoryOrganization` is false, omit the "Organize by category?" option)
- **Move completed**: Move completed unlinked plans to `plans/completed/` (sibling to plans directory)
- **Leave as-is**: Just report, no action

6. **Output state suggestion**:

If no state file exists but master plans were detected:

```
💡 Tip: Run `/plan-manager init plans/layout-engine.md` to start tracking this plan hierarchy.
```
