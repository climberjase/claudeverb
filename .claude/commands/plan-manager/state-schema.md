# State File Schema

This document describes the structure and format of the plan-manager state file.

## State File Location

State is stored in the project's `.claude/plan-manager-state.json`.

This keeps tooling metadata separate from actual plan files.

## State File Structure

```json

  "version": "1.1.0",

## Field Descriptions

### Root Level

- **version** (string): State file schema version (currently `"1.1.0"`). This tracks the state file format independently from the skill version in `version.txt`. Used for schema migrations and backward compatibility if the state file format evolves in future versions.
- **plansDirectory** (string): The base directory where plans are stored (e.g., `"plans"`, `"docs/plans"`)
- **masterPlans** (array): List of tracked master plans
- **subPlans** (array): List of all sub-plans and branches linked to master plans

### Master Plan Entry

- **path** (string): Full path to the master plan file (e.g., `"plans/layout-engine/layout-engine.md"`)
- **subdirectory** (string | null): Subdirectory name if using subdirectory organization (e.g., `"layout-engine"`), or `null` for flat structure
- **active** (boolean): Whether this is the currently active master plan
- **createdAt** (string): ISO date when master plan was initialized (e.g., `"2026-01-30"`)
- **description** (string): Brief description of what this master plan covers

### Sub-Plan Entry

- **path** (string): Full path to the sub-plan/branch file (e.g., `"plans/layout-engine/api-redesign.md"`)
- **parentPlan** (string): Path to the parent plan (master plan or another sub-plan) (e.g., `"plans/layout-engine/layout-engine.md"`)
- **parentPhase** (number | null): Phase number in the parent master plan this relates to (e.g., `3`). Null/absent when parent is a sub-plan. This field applies regardless of whether the plan uses Phase, Milestone, or Step headers.
- **parentStep** (number | null): Step number in the parent sub-plan (e.g., `3`). Set when parent is a sub-plan; null/absent when parent is a master plan. Mutually exclusive with `parentPhase`.
- **masterPlan** (string): Path to the root master plan. Always present. Equals `parentPlan` for direct children of a master plan; points to the root for deeper nesting.
- **status** (string): Current status - `"in_progress"`, `"completed"`, `"blocked"`, etc.
- **createdAt** (string): ISO date when sub-plan was created (e.g., `"2026-01-30"`)
- **type** (string): Plan type - `"sub-plan"` or `"branch"`
- **blockedBy** (array): List of blockers that prevent this sub-plan from progressing. Each item can be:
  - Phase number (e.g., `3`) - blocked by a phase in the parent master plan
  - Step number (e.g., `2.1`) - blocked by a specific step
  - Sub-plan path (e.g., `"plans/layout-engine/api-redesign.md"`) - blocked by another sub-plan
- **blocks** (array): List of phases/steps/sub-plans that are blocked by this sub-plan. Same format as `blockedBy`.

### Optional Sub-Plan Fields

- **merged** (boolean): Set to `true` if the sub-plan has been merged into the master plan
- **mergedAt** (string): ISO date when the merge occurred (e.g., `"2026-01-31"`)

### Validation Rules

- Exactly one of `parentPhase` or `parentStep` must be non-null; the other must be `null`
- If `parentStep` is set, `parentPlan` must be a path found in `subPlans[]`
- If `parentPhase` is set, `parentPlan` must be a path found in `masterPlans[]`
- `masterPlan` must always be a path found in `masterPlans[]`
- The `parentPlan` chain must not contain cycles

## Settings File Fields

The settings file (`plan-manager-settings.json`) can contain the following optional fields:

- **categoryDirectories** (object): Maps plan types to directory names (e.g., `{"documentation": "docs", "migration": "migrations"}`)
- **enableCategoryOrganization** (boolean): Whether to organize standalone plans by category (default: `true`)

## Plan Types

**Plan types** (`type` field):
- `"sub-plan"`: For implementing phases that need substantial planning
- `"branch"`: For handling unexpected issues/problems discovered during execution

## Multiple Master Plans

**Multiple master plans** are supported for projects with parallel initiatives. Commands operate on the "active" master plan by default, but can target specific masters using the `--master` flag.

Only one master plan can be active at a time. Use the `switch` command to change the active master.

## Subdirectory Organization

**Subdirectory organization** is used when a master plan has sub-plans:
- New master plans are created flat in the plans directory root by default (e.g., `plans/layout-engine.md`)
- When the first sub-plan is added to a flat master, the master is automatically promoted into a subdirectory:
  - Master moves from `plans/layout-engine.md` → `plans/layout-engine/layout-engine.md`
  - Sub-plans are created alongside it in `plans/layout-engine/`
- Use `--nested` flag on `init` to immediately create a subdirectory without waiting for a sub-plan
- The `subdirectory` field tracks whether a master uses subdirectory organization (`null` = flat)
- **Category organization**: Standalone plans can be organized into category subdirectories (migrations/, docs/, designs/, features/, etc.)
  - Category-organized plans are not tracked in state file (they're not linked to any master)
  - Category directories are configured in `plan-manager-settings.json`

## Plans Directory Configuration

The `plansDirectory` can be configured per-project. Common locations:
- `plans/` (default)
- `docs/plans/`
- `.plans/`

The plans directory can be specified in:
1. `.claude/settings.local.json` (local override, gitignored)
2. `.claude/settings.json` (project-shared)
3. State file (persisted from initialization)

See [organization.md](organization.md) for more details on plans directory detection.

## State File Initialization

If the state file doesn't exist, the `overview` command can still scan for plans; other commands will prompt to run `init` first to create the state file.

The `init` command creates the state file and adds the first master plan.
